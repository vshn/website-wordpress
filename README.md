## Instalation

Instalation is done only by 1 team member (let's call him **Admin**, and new project is **newproject**).

#### Step 1
**Admin** creates new empty repository on Gitlab (ex: http://gitlab.fsd.rs/web/newproject)

#### Step 2
##### **Admin** clones **this** repository in his projects folder like this:

    ```sh
    git clone git@gitlab.fsd.rs:web/WProject.git newproject
    ```
    
##### **Navigate** to that repository (cd **newproject**) and do following command (to switch remote branch from gitlab.fsd.rs/web/WProject to gitlab.fsd.rs/web/newproject):
    ```sh
    git remote set-url origin git@gitlab.fsd.rs:web/newProject.git
    ```
    
    You can check is remote origin changed, by typing command:
    ```sh
    git remote -v
    ```
    
    and you should see output: 
    ```sh
    origin  git@gitlab.fsd.rs:web/newproject.git (fetch)
    origin  git@gitlab.fsd.rs:web/newproject.git (push)
    ```
    So far so good!

#### Step 3
##### **Admin** can do this in few ways.
* One way is to download clean Wordpress instalation, and unzip it inside **newproject** folder (be careful not to override our wp-content with themes and plugins!).
* Other (more easier) way is, if you have wp-cli installed on your local machine.
Use command:

    ```
    wp core download
    ```
(for advance usage, visit http://wp-cli.org/)

* After this you run npm installation command:

    ```
    npm install (or yarn)
    ```

#### Step 4
* Next step depends on your local environment. If you are using xampp, vagrant, or anything, theme and setup is compatible with it. Just continue with normal instalation

#### Step 5
* In package.json, find **config.domain** and set it up like your localhost name (example: newproject.local or if you are on normal xampp/lamp/wamp/mamp setup, localhost/newproject)
    ```
    "config": {
      "domain": "newproject.local"
    },
    ```
* Code versioning control is done via Git (you already have default .gitignore inside, edit as needs require)
* Enjoy developing!

### For advance usage with vagrant, please talk with Bojan.
##Have fun!

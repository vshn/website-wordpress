            <p>Continuous Integration (CI) is the art of building and testing code on every push to a remote Git
                repository. This can include simple code checks, unit-tests or even full-blown end-to-end tests with all
                the bells and whistles. How an application has to be built and what needs to be tested heavily depends
                on the application and is different for each and every use-case.</p>
            <p>Such processes are the backbone of application development. CI pipelines should never break, neither
                because of the pushed code, nor because something is wrong with the pipeline itself, as this can bring
                the whole application development cycle to a halt. And they should be fast for a continuous feedback to
                the developer.
            </p>
            <p>In the end, CI pipelines are also application which needs maintenance and kept up-to-date.</p>
            <p>With our expert expertise we engineer CI pipelines with best-practices, pre-engineered blue-prints and
                templates which we continuosly keep up-to-date.</p>
